# Ground Hash Tool

Simple resource for displaying the current ground type you are standing on as drawtext.
This was made quickly for use with our weed script update. 
Thought it might be of use to others wanting to toy with ground types for resources. 

## INSTALL ##

1) Drag and drop `groundhashtool` into your server resources.
2) Add `ensure groundhashtool` into your server.cfg
3) Press `F8` and type `refresh; ensure groundhashtool` and the resource will run, no need to restart server.

Or

1) Copy the command from `groundhash_s.lua` into ANY server side file.
2) Copy the code from `groundhash_c.lua` into ANY client side file.
3) Restart your server/the resource you have placed the code into.

## USAGE ##

- Type /checkgroundhash to toggle ground hash draw text on/off screen *(default location = top right)*
